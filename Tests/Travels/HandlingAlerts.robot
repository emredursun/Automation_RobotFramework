Some of the keywords that I will explain in this tutorial are:
 * Handle Alert - Handles the current alert and returns its message.
 * Input Text Into Alert - Types the given text into an input field in an alert.
 * Alert Should Be Present - Verifies that an alert is present and by default, accepts it
 * Alert Should Not Be Present - Verifies that no alert is present.
